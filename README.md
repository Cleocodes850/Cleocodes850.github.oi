      <h2>Comunity Outreach</h2>

<h3>Romig</h3>
<p>
Our team has spent over 15 productive and educational hours at Romig—West's adjoining middle school. We have educated the youth of Romig by bringing the robot into their classrooms and doing presentations on robotics and STEM in general. Our presentations focused on the opportunities available to them through FIRST and in STEM. We additionally use this outreach as an opportunity to assist in their robotics elective class, and after-school club, as well as promote West's club if they want to continue robotics into High School.ts </p>

<h3> Reading Rendezvous </h3>
<p>  The Reading Rendezvous was an event at the Anchorage Public Library to raise awareness of reading. We did robotics demonstrations and engaged with the public about our club and FTC, as well as FIRST and robotics more generally. Our goal was to help urge community members who might enjoy reading about science fiction or STEM to participate in the fields themselves.</p>

<h3> Willow Crest, Government Hill, and Rogers Park </h3>
<p>  West High Robotics has been given the opportunity to present to the youngsters of various elementary schools. We led them in the construction of simple robots and encouraged them to participate in STEM and robotics.  We feel that after our presentations the students were left more aware of the opportunities available to them in the world of robotics and STEM in general. We met with at least 48 kids at Government Hill and 30 at Rogers Park. </p>

<h3> Dance West </h3>
<p> West High's own Dance Program contacted us requesting the creation of a remote-controlled, self-opening, talking book to be used as a performance prop. The Westie Besties collaborated with 19953 on this project. We faced issues with the opening of the book being unreliable, which we overcame with the help and guidance of Mr.Souza. In the end, we successfully brought the book to life, to the delight of the Dance West audience. </p>

<h3> Resource Data </h3>
<p> The industry leader Resource Data reached out to West High Robotics with an opportunity to meet with some of their engineers and collaborate on client outreach. A huge number of West robotics members were eager to help them out, and overall we had a great experience. We hope to deepen our relationship with Resource Data going forward. </p>

<h3> Freshman Fair </h3>
<p> The freshman fair was an event put on by our amazing high school to show freshmen some of the programs available at west such as our robotics club. We talked to many a freshman and got 22 passionate young minds to engage themselves with the world of West High Robotics—far more than we were anticipating! We see the freshman fair as a vital part of our sustainability as a club, especially considering the size of the turnout on the first day of robotics and the formation of 2 new teams. </p>

<h3> Da Vinci Robot </h3>
<p> Our amazing outreach crew reached out to the Da Vinci (the $2 million robot famous for doing surgery on a grape) supplier in Alaska. Because of this interaction with the community we got to go see and practice using the DA Vinci robot. we discussed the use case of this robot and the use of robots in medical and other fields. As a result of this interaction, we were able to get a Da Vinci training instrument to place in our lab. </p>

<h3> Freshman congress </h3>
<p> Freshman congress is an event held the week before school to show the freshman around and let them see where classes are, getting them ready for the there first day of school. At this very helpful event we set up a booth in the hall to spread information about our epic club and hopfully get new members. </p>

<h3> Mentoring New Teams </h3>
<p> We have also mentored your new teams 22323 and 16660(old number—all-new team). From explaining what FIRST is, to helping them build their first robot and develop their engineering portfolio. We even supplied resources like funding and parts. We even helped them through build and design hurdles. When we feel like more guidance is needed we often make presentations for the newer teams with help from 19953 (which has some other more experienced members). With 19953 focusing on helping them with code and our team helping them more with build and design, we have seen very good success from our new teams, and are excited to see how they develop through their time at West as they gain more experience. </p>

  <section id="A Look At Last Year">
        <h2>A Look At Last Year</h2>
            <h3> Pre-season </h3>

<p> <b> Identification of Problem </b>
We must be able to place cones on the top junction, as well as obtain cones in a relatively quick timeframe and park autonomously by scanning the custom-made signal sleeve. </p>

<p> <b> Generation of Concepts </b>
We decided on a sliding rail-based lifting mechanism in order to maximize speed and vertical reach. We planned to print a custom signal sleeve and read it using image recognition or color scanning. </p>

<p> <b> Development of Solutions </b>
As we developed our solutions, we worked heavily with CAD to utilize construction methods like CNC and 3d printing, which allowed us to work with a high degree of precision and develop geometrically complex parts. </p>

<p> <b> Construction </b>
Once we had all of the ideas and the parts, we built everything. It was relatively easy because everything was planned in CAD, but there were still problems to overcome as we worked. </p>

<p> <b> Test and Iteration of Design </b>
As we built the robot, we continually tested and implemented improvements. For instance, the lift has undergone significant revision over the course of the reason as we refined and improved the design. We continually used the engineering process, identifying problems, generating concepts, developing solutions to them, and then building and testing them.

<h3> Season Goals </h3>

<h3> Brainstorming </h3>

<p> At the start of the season, we brainstormed ideas for the basic design and mechanics of the robot. We discussed several ideas, starting with the most basic question of how we wanted to grab the cone, and progressing to whether we wanted to build an automatic intake and feed system for the grabber. We ultimately settled on a simple grabber with a lift, feeling that it would be simple and robust. We decided that as the season progressed we could design and implement an automatic intake system if we felt that there was a need for one.

After each competition, we talked about what problems we had encountered and what issues needed fixing. After the first league meet, we changed the claw to make it more secure and also moved the lift to a more permanent location, as size restrictions had forced us to quickly relocate it just before the meet. To accommodate these changes, we were forced to design the drivetrain, though CAD made this a relatively smooth operation. This event was a perfect example of why we made such heavy use of CAD this season, as it allowed us to focus less on getting it right the first time and instead allowed us to easily adapt when the need arose.

After the second competition, we decided to move the lift motor to address space limitations and problems with the string falling off the spool, but overall we didn't need many changes.
After the third meet, we decided to improve the team indicators and implement a better lift wiring system but with little time we decided to save changes for after that meet had concluded.
The 4th meet gave us lots of ideas to improve the robot, such as using a flexible stretchy cable to reduce tangling the claw motor on the lift, and major redesigns of the lift and claw systems, although time constraints coupled with a string of snow days prevented us from implementing many of these improvements prior to the next meet

Coming into state, we made some major overhauls, including swapping the lift motor to one with a better balance of torque and speed, using stronger string for the lift, and adding new braces to the frame of the robot. The braces served dual purposes, with the front brace acting as a plow to move cones and the rear brace acting as a battery holder. We also tidied the robot up a bit, with improved cable management and a new plate to mount the warning labels. </p>

<h3> Building + CAD </h3>
<p> <b> Making the Drive Train </b> After brainstorming, we decided on a design. We looked into the parts we currently had, the parts we could get, and what custom parts we would have to make. We started designing a custom drivetrain, and with some help from team 19953 (particularly Toa and Manning), we decided to use dead axles on our robot to solve problems we had seen on several of last year's bots. The design of our robot started with our dead axle pods and then expanded to the wooden plates that hold them in place. With some help from 19953 and our coach (Mr. Troll), we were able to finish and manufacture our drivetrain.

We have made heavy use of CAD this season, from fully designing our claw in CAD and 3D printing it to CNCing and 3D printing the majority of the drive train. CAD is a fundamental tool our team has used this year and it has helped us improve and push forward as a team. 
One of the major advantages we have noticed with fully implementing CAD this year is that we can easily change major parts of the robot and just manufacture new parts, which has been very useful with some of the problems we have had that required major redesigns, such as when we had to relocate the front drive motors to make room for the lift mechanism.

Build - Once we had completed the design and CAD for our robot, we began assembling it. First, we CNCed and 3D printed our custom parts, and we combined these with off-the-shelf parts to assemble the robot, fixing problems as they came up. Building is a very important and engaging process and required us to problem-solve and redesign on the fly. We learned to use washers and not over-tighten screws into soft wood. We had to fix important issues like cable management for our lift system so that the wire wouldn't get caught in the slide. We even had to figure out how and where to mount the motor for the lift and the location of the control hubs. For us, building drastically overlaps with design and the two processes often occur near simultaneously as we iterate and improve on our robot. </p>

<h3> Software and Coding </h3>
The story of the Westie Besties from a programming perspective can best be described as a trail of abandoned dreams ending in mediocrity. Early on, our brains were alight with beautiful ideas regarding image recognition and distance sensors. We planned to use a set of 4 distance sensors on the 4 sides of the robot for positioning and automated movement. A successful algorithm was written in order to convert data from these sensors into the position and rotation of the robot on the field. Early tests of the algorithm proved promising, and the robot's movement was clearly reflected on a control hub minimap. The project was cut short when we found that our sonar-based distance sensors possessed an overly wide 'field of view'. Readings would be returned based on objects which were off to the side of the sensor's ideal line of sight. In a final, desperate effort to circumvent this, we contacted the Pinions (Kraken Pinion, team 8680). Manning Zhang of team 19553 can be credited for this contact suggestion. Their kind and all-knowing response led us to take part in the testing of experimental paper blinders to narrow the field of view of the sensors. This was unsuccessful. The paper blinders further obstructed the sensor's readings. We were left with nothing but a poorly mounted sensor tower and many questions regarding the Pinions' claims of success. After much deliberation, we dramatically ripped off the distance sensors and left navigation up to the driver.

Our misadventures in the world of image recognition were similarly disappointing.
In order to read the signal cone during autonomous and park in the designated square, we surgically installed a webcam. The goal was to utilize a Tensorflow-based image recognition system. Despite our ambitions, we were unable to conjure a trained AI model in time. We settled for a simple image reading program that considers the average hue value within an area of the camera’s view. A signal sleeve design with solid-colored sections proved to be a reliable solution. At this point in time the robot has the remarkable ability to determine which color of the cone is facing the camera, and only occasionally has problems driving in straight lines after reading it.
