          <h2>about the team</h2>

  <p>Welcome to the Robotics Senior Team at West High School! We are a dedicated group of students passionate about robotics and technology.</p>
  <p>Our team consists of talented individuals who collaborate, innovate, and compete in various robotics competitions. We strive to push the boundaries of robotics and explore the exciting possibilities it offers.</p>
  <p>Through our involvement in robotics, we develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and teamwork skills. We believe in hands-on learning and enjoy applying our knowledge in real-world scenarios.</p>
  <p>As a senior team, we have accumulated years of experience in designing, building, and programming robots. We embrace challenges and continuously seek opportunities to learn and grow.</p>
  <p>Our goal is not only to excel in robotics competitions but also to inspire and educate others about the ever-evolving field of robotics. We actively engage with our school and community, organizing workshops, demonstrations, and outreach events.</p>
  <p>Join us on our exciting journey as we explore the fascinating world of robotics and work together to make a positive impact in our community.</p>

Mr. Troll - Team Coach
Mr. Troll has been at West High teaching math since 2015 and coaching robotics since 2019. As a novice coach with minimal robotics skills, his leadership role can best be defined as a spirited motivator, cunning recruiter, and "school employee supervisor". Through his coaching, he hopes to inspire his students to successful futures as problem solvers and STEM professionals.

Caleb
been a volunteer firefighter for about a year. I like Reaching out to the community and connecting with Romig, the middle school right next to us. I like  helping out the middle school with their robotics team because they are dweebs. Because I also used to go to Rome. I like visiting old teachers I used to have. I would like to go to UAF to get an associates degree in Fire science and paramedicine and then Bachelor's in homeland security and Emergency Management.

Aidan Ogilvie-Fiacco
I'm Aidan Ogilvie-Fiacco, I am a sophomore at West. I joined the robotics team last year because of my interest in computers and engineering. Outside of school, I like to play video games, listen to music, and practice guitar.

Ben
I am Benjamin, a sophomore at West high school. I started doing FIRST robotics in 5th grade and I plan to continue through high school. I am excited for this year because it is in person and I am very excited this year to be the driver of the robot. I am also the business lead and help with outreach and team tasks.

      <h2>comunity outreach</h2>

<h3>Romig</h3>
<p>
Our team has spent over 15 productive and educational hours at Romigâ€”West's adjoining middle school. We have educated the youth of Romig by bringing the robot into their classrooms and doing presentations on robotics and STEM in general. Our presentations focused on the opportunities available to them through FIRST and in STEM. We additionally use this outreach as an opportunity to assist in their robotics elective class, and after-school club, as well as promote West's club if they want to continue robotics into High School.ts </p>

<h2> Reading Rendezvous </h2>
<p>  The Reading Rendezvous was an event at the Anchorage Public Library to raise awareness of reading. We did robotics demonstrations and engaged with the public about our club and FTC, as well as FIRST and robotics more generally. Our goal was to help urge community members who might enjoy reading about science fiction or STEM to participate in the fields themselves.</p>
