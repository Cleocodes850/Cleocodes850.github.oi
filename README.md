          <h2>about the team</h2>

  <p>Welcome to the Robotics Senior Team at West High School! We are a dedicated group of students passionate about robotics and technology.</p>
  <p>Our team consists of talented individuals who collaborate, innovate, and compete in various robotics competitions. We strive to push the boundaries of robotics and explore the exciting possibilities it offers.</p>
  <p>Through our involvement in robotics, we develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and teamwork skills. We believe in hands-on learning and enjoy applying our knowledge in real-world scenarios.</p>
  <p>As a senior team, we have accumulated years of experience in designing, building, and programming robots. We embrace challenges and continuously seek opportunities to learn and grow.</p>
  <p>Our goal is not only to excel in robotics competitions but also to inspire and educate others about the ever-evolving field of robotics. We actively engage with our school and community, organizing workshops, demonstrations, and outreach events.</p>
  <p>Join us on our exciting journey as we explore the fascinating world of robotics and work together to make a positive impact in our community.</p>

Mr. Troll - Team Coach
Mr. Troll has been at West High teaching math since 2015 and coaching robotics since 2019. As a novice coach with minimal robotics skills, his leadership role can best be defined as a spirited motivator, cunning recruiter, and "school employee supervisor". Through his coaching, he hopes to inspire his students to successful futures as problem solvers and STEM professionals.

Caleb
been a volunteer firefighter for about a year. I like Reaching out to the community and connecting with Romig, the middle school right next to us. I like  helping out the middle school with their robotics team because they are dweebs. Because I also used to go to Rome. I like visiting old teachers I used to have. I would like to go to UAF to get an associates degree in Fire science and paramedicine and then Bachelor's in homeland security and Emergency Management.

Aidan Ogilvie-Fiacco
I'm Aidan Ogilvie-Fiacco, I am a sophomore at West. I joined the robotics team last year because of my interest in computers and engineering. Outside of school, I like to play video games, listen to music, and practice guitar.

Ben
I am Benjamin, a sophomore at West high school. I started doing FIRST robotics in 5th grade and I plan to continue through high school. I am excited for this year because it is in person and I am very excited this year to be the driver of the robot. I am also the business lead and help with outreach and team tasks.

      <h2>comunity outreach</h2>

<h3>Romig</h3>
<p>
Our team has spent over 15 productive and educational hours at Romig—West's adjoining middle school. We have educated the youth of Romig by bringing the robot into their classrooms and doing presentations on robotics and STEM in general. Our presentations focused on the opportunities available to them through FIRST and in STEM. We additionally use this outreach as an opportunity to assist in their robotics elective class, and after-school club, as well as promote West's club if they want to continue robotics into High School.ts </p>

<h2> Reading Rendezvous </h2>
<p>  The Reading Rendezvous was an event at the Anchorage Public Library to raise awareness of reading. We did robotics demonstrations and engaged with the public about our club and FTC, as well as FIRST and robotics more generally. Our goal was to help urge community members who might enjoy reading about science fiction or STEM to participate in the fields themselves.</p>

<h2> Willow Crest, Government Hill, and Rogers Park </h2>
<p>  West High Robotics has been given the opportunity to present to the youngsters of various elementary schools. We led them in the construction of simple robots and encouraged them to participate in STEM and robotics.  We feel that after our presentations the students were left more aware of the opportunities available to them in the world of robotics and STEM in general. We met with at least 48 kids at Government Hill and 30 at Rogers Park. </p>

<h2> Dance West </h2>
<p> West High's own Dance Program contacted us requesting the creation of a remote-controlled, self-opening, talking book to be used as a performance prop. The Westie Besties collaborated with 19953 on this project. We faced issues with the opening of the book being unreliable, which we overcame with the help and guidance of Mr.Souza. In the end, we successfully brought the book to life, to the delight of the Dance West audience. </p>

<h2> Resource Data </h2>
<p> The industry leader Resource Data reached out to West High Robotics with an opportunity to meet with some of their engineers and collaborate on client outreach. A huge number of West robotics members were eager to help them out, and overall we had a great experience. We hope to deepen our relationship with Resource Data going forward. </p>

<h2> Freshman Fair </h2>
<p> The freshman fair was an event put on by our amazing high school to show freshmen some of the programs available at west such as our robotics club. We talked to many a freshman and got 22 passionate young minds to engage themselves with the world of West High Robotics—far more than we were anticipating! We see the freshman fair as a vital part of our sustainability as a club, especially considering the size of the turnout on the first day of robotics and the formation of 2 new teams. </p>

<h2> Da Vinci Robot </h2>
<p> Our amazing outreach crew reached out to the Da Vinci (the $2 million robot famous for doing surgery on a grape) supplier in Alaska. Because of this interaction with the community we got to go see and practice using the DA Vinci robot. we discussed the use case of this robot and the use of robots in medical and other fields. As a result of this interaction, we were able to get a Da Vinci training instrument to place in our lab. </p>

<h2> Freshman congress </h2>
<p> Freshman congress is an event held the week before school to show the freshman around and let them see where classes are, getting them ready for the there first day of school. At this very helpful event we set up a booth in the hall to spread information about our epic club and hopfully get new members. </p>

<h2> Mentoring New Teams </h2>
<p> We have also mentored your new teams 22323 and 16660(old number—all-new team). From explaining what FIRST is, to helping them build their first robot and develop their engineering portfolio. We even supplied resources like funding and parts. We even helped them through build and design hurdles. When we feel like more guidance is needed we often make presentations for the newer teams with help from 19953 (which has some other more experienced members). With 19953 focusing on helping them with code and our team helping them more with build and design, we have seen very good success from our new teams, and are excited to see how they develop through their time at West as they gain more experience. </p>
